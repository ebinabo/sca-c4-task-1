            <h1>Biography</h1>
    
            <p>
                To many, Milton Glaser is the embodiment of American graphic design during the 
                latter half of this century. His presence and impact on the profession internationally 
                is formidable. Immensely creative and articulate, he is a modern renaissance man 
                â€” one of a rare breed of intellectual designer-illustrators, who brings 
                a depth of understanding and conceptual thinking, combined with a diverse richness of 
                visual language, to his highly inventive and individualistic work. *

                Born in 1929, Milton Glaser was educated at the High School of Music 
                and Art and the Cooper Union art school in New York and, via 
                a Fulbright Scholarship, the Academy of Fine Arts in Bologna, Italy. He 
                co-founded the revolutionary Pushpin Studios in 1954, founded New York Magazine 
                with Clay Felker in 1968, established Milton Glaser, Inc. in 1974, 
                and teamed with Walter Bernard in 1983 to form the publication design firm WBMG. 
                Throughout his career, Glaser has been a prolific creator of posters and prints. 
                His artwork has been featured in exhibits worldwide, including one-man shows at 
                both the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. 
                His work is in the permanent collections of many museums. Glaser also is a renowned 
                graphic and architectural designer with a body of work ranging from the iconic logo 
                to complete graphic and decorative programs for the restaurants in the World Trade 
                Center in New York. Glaser is an influential figure in both the design and education 
                communities and has contributed essays and granted interviews extensively on design. 
                Among many awards throughout the years, he received the 2004 Lifetime Achievement Award 
                from the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, for his profound and meaningful 
                long-term contribution to the contemporary practice of design.
