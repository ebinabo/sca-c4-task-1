                Milton Glaser, Inc. was established in 1974. The work 
                produced at this Manhattan studio encompasses a wide range 
                of design disciplines. In the area of print graphics, the 
                studio produces identity programs for corporate and 
                institutional marketing purposes - including logos, stationery, 
                brochures, signage, and annual reports. In the field of 
                environmental and interior design, the firm has conceptualized 
                and site-supervised the fabrication of numerous products, exhibitions, 
                interiors and exteriors of restaurants, shopping malls, supermarkets, 
                hotels, and other retail and commercial environments. Glaser is also 
                personally responsible for the design and illustration of more than 
                300 posters for clients in the areas of publishing, music, theater, 
                film, institutional and civic enterprise, as well as those for commercial 
                products and services. The studio continues to be a dynamic and lively 
                place to work and create.
